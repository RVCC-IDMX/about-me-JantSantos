            <h2>Working Title</h2>

            <div>
                <p>We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending.
                    Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in
                    the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose
                    broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.</p>

                <p>How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the reading of them. All
                    needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history almost at variance with the possibilities
                    of later-day belief may stand forth as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of past things
                    wherein memory may err, for all the records chosen are exactly contemporary, given from the
                    standpoints and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.</p>

                <p>The morning of 16 May broke bright and cheerful. The sun shone warm and brilliant, and the birds sang
                    sweetly in the trees. The very air seemed full of hope and happiness. I felt that the cloud of gloom
                    which had been hanging over us for so long was lifting, and that we were about to enter upon a new
                    phase of our strange and terrible experience.</p>
