            <h2>About ME!</h2>
            <p>-Hello! My name is Jant Ericson Santos. I migrated from the Philippines a year ago 
                and to permanently stay in America. I studied a year of undergraduate degree on Civil Engineering 
                back in the Philippines but decided to pursue Information technology. Ever since I was little, computers
                have always sparked curiousity inside me.</p>
            <p>-I used to compete in VALORANT back in the Philippines. Playing competitively was a big passion of mine because 
                the grind to improve as a player, the adrenaline during the matches, having fun with playing with my teammates 
                motivated me. That mindset of constant improvement has carried over even in different aspects of my life</p>
            <p>-Now, I'm not really sure yet what field I want to focus on but one thing is for sure that I want to better my 
                knowledge in computers, graduate, and make my parents proud.</p>

            <h2>CSS ANIMATIONS</h2>

            <div>
                <p>CSS Animations allows a web designer to create animated objects on  without the use of other
                    programming language like Javascript. There
                    
                </p>

                <p>How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the reading of them. All
                    needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history almost at variance with the possibilities
                    of later-day belief may stand forth as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of past things
                    wherein memory may err, for all the records chosen are exactly contemporary, given from the
                    standpoints and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.</p>

                <p>The morning of 16 May broke bright and cheerful. The sun shone warm and brilliant, and the birds sang
                    sweetly in the trees. The very air seemed full of hope and happiness. I felt that the cloud of gloom
                    which had been hanging over us for so long was lifting, and that we were about to enter upon a new
                    phase of our strange and terrible experience.</p>
