Hello, My name is Jant Ericson Santos a student from Raritan Valley Community College hereby presents you my final project on 
Webpage Development (IDMX-225-2). This project showcases a brief description of myself, my background, my hobbies, and the skills that
I have learned for the time being while studying Webpage Development.

The HTML Structure that this website contains are <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <figure>/<figcaption>,<form>/<fieldset>/<input>,
and <footer>. Every section of this got me to practice on how to style it properly while not neglecting the user's readability. Each section helped me better my skill for using different aspects in HTML and CSS such as the use of selectors(ID and Class) for each section, propper indentations, again styling for CSS which is most of my time was spent.

For my header, I gave it a higher-border radius compared to the other sections in order to capture the attention of the future users while
having a minimal and sleek design. This sets the tone for my website.

For my Bio and Hobbies, I made it smaller but again applying sleek design with sharpish vibe edges. It is readable and has a good visual balance.

For my Gallery section, I added a hover effect on it to make it interactive, unique and engaging for the users. For me this is my favorite
part of my website but it is where I also struggled the most.

For my Blog and iFrame, I kept it simple as well and it is also noticably bigger for bigger devices because its content it very informative and I want the users to focus on the content inside it.

Lastly, for my Contact, I kept it relatively small as well but still having that sleek border design that is shown al throughout the webpage.
